;In the program writen below by mohan sir,
;keypad must have 3 rows and 8 columns.
;But most said it had even more rows,But in case there are more rows you can just change the program easily for that many 
;rows by changing one specific register content which ill tell later.

;In this program we have two ports,
;pc->output port
;pa->intput port

;And the selections or requests are made through active high signal unlike that of elevator program.
;In elevator for 2nd floor would be 1101 so we were checking for a zero.
;In keypad it would be opposite and we would be searching for a one.

;At the end of the program,
;you need to have row and column values in memory,
;and something called as scan code is to displayed on the moniter.

;what is a scan code?

;imagine we have a 3*3 keypad,

;8 7 6
;5 4 3
;2 1 0

;remember scan codes are calculated from right to left (I'm 100% sure about it) , and bottom to down(I'm not sure).
;Scan codes are just a number assigned to a specific key,ie 4th key 5th key etc and (i hope it isn't the actual contents.)(Im 70% sure it isn't).

;In the above 3*3 I have started to number keys from right to left and starting from bottom to top.
;Remember the contents(it could be alphabets or operator or anything ) but those are different are different from the scan code(which just mentions the position
;of the perticular key) and it doent represent the contents.

;The main program has 2 parts
;1)get the row,column and scancode
;2)convert scancode to ascii so that we can display it.

;Starting with the first part:

;>We have pc as the output port and pa as the input port.
;>We select a perticular row by outputing it the port c
 ; ex: 1st row 0000 0001 (active high selection)
;>Then from port a we input ,all the columns in first row.If any key was pressed in that specific row,our input(columns) will have 
;atleast one active high signal representing that columns ex input(00000010) represents 2nd column.
  
 ; assume the key was pressed in 2nd row(starting from bottom) and 2nd column(starting from right),
  ;>>>we would fist output to pc row one(0000 0001) and then take the input from pa all the column values.As the key wasn't pressed
  ;in 1st row all the bits in input will be zero(0000 0000)(this signifies no key was pressed in that row)
  ;>>>next we left rotate what we had previously outputed and that will be (0000 0010) and output this,Thus we selected 2nd row,
  ;Now we take the input from port a,As the key was pressed from 2nd column are input will be 0000 0010.
  
  ;Thus you must understand 
  ;>We continuesly select rows (starting from bottom to top) by outputing to port c
  ;>After we select a perticular row,we take input from port a,This input represents the columns present in that row,
   ;And if any key was pressed in that row,the input we get will atleast contain one 1,reperesenting the column in which the key was pressed
   
  ;>Imagine we have 5 rows 
   ; >we start with row 1 ,if we dont find move to row 2 then go till row 5,
    ;>After that?Once we have covered all the rows?
    ;>We repeat it again
    ;>ie start from 1 til row 5
    ;>This will be hapennin very fast and infinitely.
   
  ; Now comming to the scan code,
   ;>In the example keypad i showed above,there were 3 rows and 3 columns
   ;>Now im calculating scan code,first i will select row by outputing to port c then take the input from port a,But unfortuantily all the values 
   ;are zero signifying that key was not present in that row.Now what happens to scan code?
  ;>Initially scan code will be zero,if we dont find in a row we increment by the number of columns,ie it will be 0+3 = 3, and coninue will the remaining rows
  ;>You might be thinking this would only hold good if the key being pressed was only the leftmost key as it would only take values 0,3,6.
  ;>The answer is will will later fine tune it
  ;ex: if the key being pressed was in 2nd row and 2nd column
  ;then as out key isnt in 1st row,we would increment scan code by 3,so temporarily our scan code is 3.
  ;later in 2nd row we detect the key stoke,ie in 2nd columns (0000 0010)
  ;Now what i will do is i will start right rotating this , if i dont find a 0 i will increment scan code by 1
  ;so in my first attempt i fail,so 3+1 = 4 in my second attempt i find a 1,so i stop.
  ;So that 2nd row 2nd column key was 4th key.
  ;Thus we got our key as the 4th key.
  ;>Remeber we use the same method to caculate the column number also
  
    
;>>2nd part
;converting scan code in hexadecimal to ascii equivalent to print on screen

;imagine we have 8*4 keypad


;1f 1f1e 1d 1c 1b 1a 19
;18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11
;f  e  d  c  b  a  9  8
;7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

;So we would have any of this hexadecimal code obatined after all this step
;now lets take the worst case and find how to display it.
;take 1f.
;if 1fth key was pressed we have to display 1f on the moniter.

;1f=0001 1111

;first we copy it to some register say al
;al=0001 1111
;now we shift it right that will be 0000 0001
;so we were able to isolate the left digit ,
;now we will add 30h to get ascii equivalent and display it using 02h interupt

;now about the second digit

;1f=0001 1111

;we mask the left 4 bits
;ie and bl,0f
;hoping that it was stored in bl
;now bl will have 0000 1111


;so we have isolated second digit
;>>>>>Here the important thing to display alpahbets we need to add first 30h and aslo 7h,(Take a look at the ascii table there is 7 blocks gap betwee 9 and a)

;So if its between 0 and 9 we add 30h and display
;if its a to f we add 30h and then 7h also

;Now lets go to program
